				 There once was a young, immature little boy named Johnny. One day while playing his favourite game, Battle Sharks third edition, his rusty hunk o' junk PC made of cheez whiz finally disintegrated. Johnny was in desperate need of a new computer (to play battle sharks, of course), so he went to the Microsoft factory and stole all of the product- you know what, you get the gist. Johnny did everything wrong (no offence johnny), and building a gaming PC is no joke. A gaming computer enables the gamer to have proper gaming experiences with precise actions and lifelike graphics.This project is all about making one! Our budget is $3100 dollars, and we are supposed to make a PC containing all of the parts needed to make it fully functional. With the help of PCPARTPICKER, we now have a fully compatible, state of the art PC with some amazing features such as a multi-purpose software that allows the user to utilize the PC for daily use, as well as gaming, and short descriptions of each and every piece so you can see if you would like it in your PC. Hope you enjoy it!
