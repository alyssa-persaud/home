				 Growing up, I was raised in an active family that enjoyed athletic activities. When I was a new-born child, my father introduced me to a variety of sports such as soccer, cycling, basketball, and swimming. As I grew, I began to develop a passion for basketball and swimming more than the other sports.
				I was first enrolled in a basketball league and gradually moved onto other leagues to enhance my abilities, however, my skill level remained the same. Through a friend, I joined an organization that challenges me to push my limits, which continues to improve my techniques.
				As a child, I enjoyed water activities, which led me to swimming. I originally started with swimming lessons at local pools and recreation facilities. As my enthusiasm for swimming increased, I began to swim with my family during our vacations to the Caribbean and eventually progressed to pre-competition swimming, which provides me a balance with basketball in my life.
