				 I was born and raised a Christian Torontonian with a Chinese and Trinidadian heritage. My first experience in Trinidad that I can remember was when I was nine years old, however, the most memorable part of each trip was the food and the weather. 
				 Throughout my time in Trinidad, I was introduced to a variety of traditional foods and fruits that I was unable to obtain in Canada, due to the weather conditions. 
				 Although Trinidad's weather is an advantage to certain things, it can also increase the number of insects and the occasional tropical storms.
				 Although I have never visited China, I have learned many aspects of my heritage from my relatives such as their customs, religions, and folk tales. Along with trying a variety of Chinese cuisines such as har gow,  barbeque pork bun, and moon cake during our Chinese New Year. Celebrating Chinese New Year allowed me to experience the customs of Chinese traditions and their history.
